Kconfig is the configuration language used by the Linux kernel. This package
is a simple copy of the frontends and the parser found in the Linux kernel
source tree, with very minor changes to adapt them to being built out of
the kernel build infrastructure.

This package has been ported to Windows, so the code has been changed to get
it work properly. The package also contains a copy PDCurses with some minor
changes. By now only the the mconf tool has been ported.

Under non Windows platforms use the original package from:
http://ymorin.is-a-geek.org/projects/kconfig-frontends

Note: if using the git tree, or changing the autostuff sources, you'll first
have to run:
    autoreconf -fi
